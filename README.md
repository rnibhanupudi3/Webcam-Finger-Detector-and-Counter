# Webcam-Finger-Detector-and-Counter
- Project adapted from "Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning" Udemy course
- Utilized OpenCV, numpy, and sci-kit learn to identify the hand and detect fingers held up
- Isolated hand segment and separate it from background using thresholds and contours
- Formed convex hull from hand segment and used Euclidean distances to draw circle centered at palm to count fingers
